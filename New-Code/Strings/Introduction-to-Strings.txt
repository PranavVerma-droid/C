Introduction to Strings

Your very first exercise in this course was the traditional task of printing the line “Hello World” to the screen.
In this lesson, we will dive deeper into the data type of “Hello World” and explore its properties and functions.
In C, the line “Hello World” is known as a string as it is simply a string of characters. Strings are very important
in programming and software engineering as they allow the program to display output to the user and can even be used to
debug errors. In the C programming language, a string is represented by an array of chars and is consequently subject to
all the properties and methods associated with arrays. The most common function used with strings is the printf() function
as you have seen before.
