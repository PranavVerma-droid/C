//If you don't want others (or yourself) to override existing variable values, use the const keyword (read only):
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
const int minutesPerHour = 60;
const float PI = 3.14;

/*Another thing about constant variables, is that it is considered good practice to declare them with uppercase.
It is not required, but useful for code readability and common for C programmers:*/
