/*
As we said before, arrays can contain any kind of data type, be it int, char, or anything
else. Interestingly, arrays can also store other arrays! An array containing other arrays is
known as a multidimensional array. These kinds of arrays are frequently used in mathematical
applications that involve matrices and vectors. Similar to its single dimension counterpart,
a multidimensional array can be initialized or uninitialized upon its creation. Letâ€™s take a
look at the uninitialized version first. The following is a two-dimensional array of integers
called mat which represents a three-by-four matrix:

int mat[3][4];

The previous code indicates that the array mat contains three elements each of which is an
array that contains four integers. To visualize this, consider a row of three lockers, in
which each locker contains four sub-lockers that someone can store items in. To illustrate
how to create an initialized multidimensional array, we will create a two-by-three
multidimensional array called mat2 composed of random integer values.

int mat2[][3] = {{1, 6, 3}, {5, 9, 2}};

Just like in the single dimension case, the array is initialized by placing elements between
{} brackets. In this case, the elements inside the outermost brackets are arrays of three
elements each. It is important to note that while the two-by-three dimension can be inferred
from the right-hand side of the expression, the only dimension that can be omitted is the
first (notice the first [] is empty); all others must be supplied. The array mat2, represents
this table:

While it is possible to have a theoretically infinite number of dimensions, in practice,
dimensions greater than two are very rare. For a two-dimensional matrix, the first dimension
represents the number of rows and the second dimension represents the number of columns.

  int arr[9][9];
  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here.
  int matrix[3][3] = {{2, 9, 11}, {3, 1, 4}, {8, 3, 1}};
